Some basic physics simulations, simulating gravity, bouncing, and collisions. For main3.py, The sprites will collide in strange ways if they are both moving the same way. This is because the collisions do not take into account the relative orientation of each sprite to eachother. Sprites that are colliding in opposite directions work as intended.
